# Join the project selection committee! <a name="join-the-project-selection-committee"></a>

Thanks for being interested in joining the committee. The central task of the
project selection committee is, of course, selecting projects; but more
broadly, it's a way to get involved in the overall Fix Planet Club organisation.

All our important documents are [public on
GitHub](https://github.com/FixPlanet/org).

## Expectations

- **Project review** - Willingness, ability and time to review projects and participate
in project interviews. Estimated time committment: 4-5 hours per month.
- **Community involvement** - Willingness to join our [slack
community](https://join.slack.com/t/fixplanetclub/shared_invite/zt-1dwnqqvuc-5sXa4HYsl81T9N35W~M9CA) and involve yourself in discussions that pique your interest.
- **Internal governance** - Interest in participating in our general
governance process, by participating in discussions on slack and/or GitHub
around the overall project structure and operating procedures. Ultimately,
responsibility for these decisions sits with the [trustees](/committee.html), but pragmatically 
we believe that they should be established and discussed openly as a community.
- **Term** - The expectation is that you will be on the committee for at least 1 year.
- **Advocate** - A willingness to advocate for the program within your
communities. A big part of the way we hope to reach diverse groups of people
is through our committee members.

## Criteria

You don't need to be an expert to join this group. The essential conditions
are:

1. You (roughly[^agree]) agree with our [operating principles and core mission](https://github.com/FixPlanet/org#mission),
2. You bring a perspective, set of personal experiences, local knowledge
   and expertise that isn't already well-covered by our [existing committee
   members](/committee.html). We value diversity, and are working hard to ensure this is
   represented in our committee make-up,
3. You have a passion for _somehow_ bringing technology, and critical (re-)thinking
   to bear on the climate (and associated) crises.

## Operations

- The total size of the committee will be limited to 15 people.
- Each project submission will be evaluated by a subset of the total pool
of committee members (exactly how we do that is TBD, join the [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fixplanetclub/shared_invite/zt-1dwnqqvuc-5sXa4HYsl81T9N35W~M9CA) to discuss!).
- Committee membership will be reviewed by the existing committee and approved by the 
trustees, as a formality.

## Next steps

If you'd like to join, please reach out to us at
[fixplanetclub@protonmail.com](mailto:fixplanetclub@protonmail.com), or on
[slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fixplanetclub/shared_invite/zt-1dwnqqvuc-5sXa4HYsl81T9N35W~M9CA), and we'll be in touch for a chat!

## Other ways of participating

Note that it is certainly _not_ necessary to join the project selection
committee to otherwise have a say on how we operate. Our
[slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fixplanetclub/shared_invite/zt-1dwnqqvuc-5sXa4HYsl81T9N35W~M9CA)
is open to all and we invite your particiation, as is our [governing documents
on GitHub](https://github.com/FixPlanet/org). If you're curious to see how we
operate, then following along on either of these platforms is the best way to get an
understanding.

[^agree]: We don't need you to agree 100%; in fact, it's probably useful if you
bring some alternative perspectives and challenge our thinking.
