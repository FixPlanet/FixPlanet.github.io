# Join the project selection committee! <a name="join-the-project-selection-committee"></a>

Thanks for being interested in joining the committee. The central task of the
project selection committee is, of course, selecting projects; but more
broadly, it's a way to get involved in the organisation of Fix Planet Club
itself.

All our important documents are [public on
GitHub](https://github.com/FixPlanet/org).

## Expectations

- **Project review** - Willingness and ability to review projects and participate
in project interviews. Expected time committment: 4-5 hours per month.
- **Community involvement** - Willingness to join our [slack
community](https://join.slack.com/t/fixplanetclub/shared_invite/zt-1dwnqqvuc-5sXa4HYsl81T9N35W~M9CA) and involve yourself in discussions that pique your interest.
- **Internal governance** - Interest in participating in our general
governance process, by participating in discussions on slack and/or GitHub
around the overall project structure and operating procedures. Ultimately,
responsibility for these decisions sits with the [trustees](/committee.html), but we believe that
they should be established and discussed as a community.
- **Term** - The expectation is that you will be on the committee for 1 year.
Committee membership will be reviewed and approved by the trustees.

## Criteria

You don't need to be an expert to join this group. The essential conditions
are:

1. You (roughly[^agree]) agree with our [operating principles and core mission](https://github.com/FixPlanet/org#mission),
2. You've bring a perspective, set of personal experiences, or local knowledge
   and expertise that isn't already well-covered by our [existing committee
   members](/committee.html). We value diversity, and would like this to be
   representing our committee,
3. You have a passion for _somehow_ bringing technology, and critical thinking
   thereof, to bear on the climate (and associated) crises.


## Next steps

If you'd like to join, please reach out to us at
[fixplanetclub@protonmail.com](mailto:fixplanetclub@protonmail.com), or on
[slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fixplanetclub/shared_invite/zt-1dwnqqvuc-5sXa4HYsl81T9N35W~M9CA), and we'll be in touch for a chat!

[^agree]: We don't need you to agree 100%; in fact, it's probably useful if you
bring some alternative perspectives and challenge our thinking.
